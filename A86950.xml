            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Gentleman came in a Coach to the Scaffold, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Sheriffs of <hi>London;</hi> and al≈øo in his company one of his Servants and Doctor <hi>Hide.</hi>

               <p>A popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous City, God ble≈øs it, and grant they may live to his Grace. Then turning to his Man, he ≈øaid, <hi>John,</hi> I pray now though I have not been a good Ma≈øter to you, be you a good Servant, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me with your Prayers, and help me both in Body and Minde. <hi>John,</hi> Have you my things about you, <hi>John?</hi>

               <p>On this day ≈øeven-night I was ≈øummoned before that Ju≈øtice, which condemned me on Friday la≈øt, prai≈øed be Almighty God, that by this way he hath brought me the nearer to Him≈øelf <stage>(putting off his Hat)</stage> My Charge I pre≈øume is publike, as my Puni≈øhment is vi≈øible: if there have been any thing in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my part, being unskilful, having di≈øcontinued my own Countrey many years, I ≈øhall be≈øeech the Chri≈øtian Charity of all you my beloved Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to impute it unto the right part, The ignorance that is in this skilful way of managing: It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected unto me there, That I had a vanity of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ≈øpeak in ≈øtrange Tongues. I was be≈øt skill'd in the <hi>Italian</hi> (but free from that vanity I thank Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God) and therefore I would in defence of my life (if it had been the Cu≈øtom here, or the Judges favor) have u≈øed that Language.</p>
               <p>It was objected, That I did not ≈øo freely as a through-paced Cavalier, own my Ma≈øter: I was told ≈øince I came into <hi>England</hi> (for other skill I have not in your Laws) that a legal Denial in Law might be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; I hope I did not exceed the Bounds of that in anything, for God forbid that I ≈øhould be a≈øhamed of ≈øerving ≈øo good, ≈øo pious, ≈øo ju≈øt a Ma≈øter <hi>(putting off his hat)</hi> for that therein I rejoyce, and I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeech
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116763:4"/>Almighty God, to fill my heart and my tongue, and all that hear me this day, with thankfulne≈øs for it.</p>
               <p>As to the Bu≈øine≈øs, that another Con≈øtruction had been made and believed here, then what was there, the Righteous God knoweth it; if any weakne≈øs is in the management, tho≈øe were mine: I was ≈øent to ≈øerve and protect, not to injure any, and as God acquits me of the intention in matter of Fact, as having done any maner of evil that way, however here under≈øtood, ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed be his holy Name, <stage>(putting off his hat)</stage> ≈øo tho≈øe Gentlemen of the Turky Company, if they would but ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider, for they know it very well, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øibility of my doing them any maner of harm. Whereas that of the Emba≈ø≈øie objected again≈øt me, that my Ma≈øter never honored me withal, I was never wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it, I was his Me≈ø≈øenger an <hi>Internuncio,</hi> for the Con≈øervation onely of his good Subjects, of all the Merchants, untill ≈øuch time as he could confirm that Gentleman now Re≈øident, or to ≈øend any other; and they them≈øelves know that there was impo≈ø≈øibility in me (as I ble≈øs God there was an innocency in me) unto any ≈øuch intention to do them any harm; for my Ma≈øters Commands were point-blank the contrary; I was onely ≈øent for their good, as I never owned the Title, ≈øo the very Letters them≈øelves ≈øpeaking no other: I never did ≈øo much as think of any maner of Addre≈øs unto the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> but gave him the Letter from my Ma≈øter; the re≈øt of the Engli≈øh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that were there pre≈øent, may, when they plea≈øe, a≈ø≈øert ≈øo much. This I would in≈øert, that tho≈øe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as they have been lo≈øers by the mi≈øcarriages of others, may now have no breach of their Charity with me; but if it be, as it ≈øeems it is now in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116763:5"/>a Sin to be Loyal, I hope my God hath forgiven that, when it is upon harmle≈øs Imployment, not inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any, according to his ju≈øt Ma≈øters Order; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have been always bred up in that Religion, my Allegiance hath been incorporated into my Religion, and I have thought it a great part of the ≈øervice due from me to Almighty God, to ≈øerve the King <stage>(putting off his hat.)</stage> I need not make any Apology for any thing in relation to the pre≈øent things in <hi>England,</hi> for were I (as I ≈øpake before my Judges) were I as evil as my Sentence hath here made me black, it were impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible for me to have prejudiced any body in <hi>England,</hi> or to <hi>England</hi> belonging, in that imployment; but I ble≈øs God for his infinite Mercy in Je≈øus Chri≈øt <stage>(put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his hat)</stage> who hath brought me home to him here in this way, it was the be≈øt Phy≈øick for the curing of my Soul, and tho≈øe that have done it, have no more power then that of my body. I leave nothing behinde me, but that I am willing to part withal; all that I am going to, is de≈øireable: And that you may all know that Almighty God hath totally wrought in me a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Denial of my ≈øelf, and that there is that perfect Reformation of me within, and of my own corruptions by the ble≈ø≈øed A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of his holy Spirit, I de≈øire Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in the abundance of the bowels of his Mercy in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, not onely to forgive every Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, (if any ≈øuch be in the world, here or where≈øoever) but to bring him into his bo≈øom ≈øo much good and particular comfort, as he may at any time, whether the Cau≈øe were ju≈øt or unju≈øt, have wi≈øhed me any maner of evil, for I take him to be the happy In≈øtrument of bringing me to Heaven. It is tedious, but I have an inward comfort, I ble≈øs Almighty God: (pray Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen

               <p>But as to that part, Mr. Sheriff, that did concern the Denial (as it was affirmed by Ma≈øter Attorney General) of my Ma≈øters imployment, Truly landing at <hi>Whitehall</hi> I told that Councel, there was ju≈øt Commi≈ø≈øions to an old Officer by the ble≈ø≈øing of God, I have by me, and I have other good things that God hath ble≈ø≈øed me withal, more then all the good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians in the world, that are not the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Slaves; and we that are Merchants abroad, we allow our ≈øelves any ≈øufferance that may induce to our own ≈øafety, inlargement of Trade, or pre≈øervation of what is ours. Why I had by the grace of my gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter a confirmation of my old Commi≈ø≈øion of <hi>Con≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> in <hi>Greece;</hi> but as to the Emba≈ø≈øie, no more then my Credential Letters did ≈øpeak, nor no more then that I attempted, an <hi>Internuncio</hi> they call it in tho≈øe places, which is a Me≈ø≈øenger between the one and the other King. They both unhappily dyed of ≈øeveral deaths, and both violent too; and it is a cu≈øtom not unknown to you, Ma≈øter Sheriff, and other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that practice in the world, that Princes of cour≈øe, for the continuation of Amity, do ≈øend Me≈ø≈øengers where there is peace, that the Tran≈øaction of tho≈øe publike Expre≈ø≈øions of recipocrol Affections may be performed; but for Emba≈ø≈øie, God forbid I ≈øhould own it, I never had it, however they have u≈øed it as the happy means to bring me to God this day. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeech God in the bowels of my Saviour, to forgive
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116763:6"/>tho≈øe people that have done it, as I owe them no harm, ≈øo God pay them home with all the good of this, and an everla≈øting Life.</p>
               <p>As for Power, I have been long ab≈øent here in <hi>England,</hi> I meddle with none: Sufficient for me is Gods Grace to the Salvation of my Soul.</p>
               <p>I have been always fearful of offending Almighty God, according to the Grace he hath given me: But to learn a New-Religion, and New-Ways (that I mu≈øt ≈øay Ma≈øter Sheriff to you, and all others that hear me) I cannot di≈øpence with my Con≈øcience to give offence to Almighty God. I am now (if it may be with your Commi≈ø≈øion, Ma≈øter Sheriff) to pour out my Soul to Almighty God in two or three words (the place is ≈øtraitned.) If I knew wherein to give any ≈øatisfaction to any thing what≈øoever, wherein I have offended or no, I am here in the fear of God to do it. I forgive with all my Soul, and my forgivene≈øs is clear, as I am now going to receive Happine≈øs at the hand of my Saviour: But if I thought it were ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Sir <hi>Thomas Bendi≈øh,</hi> and all the Company, or any who may think they have offended me, I am come Ma≈øter Sheriff to pay that Obedience willingly; that Debt I owe to Nature, to pay it upon the ≈øcore of a Subject; becau≈øe Con≈øcience within me, tells-me not, that for the intentions of ≈øerving my Prince, that I could de≈øerve ≈øuch a Death, though Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand times more other ways.</p>

               <p>I humbly thank you for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring me of it, and if any be here of the <hi>Turky</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116763:6"/>this day, or any Friend of theirs, I ≈øhall de≈øire them from a dying Man, to take this truth, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Brother, my innocent Brother that is with me, nor other Gentlemen with me in my company, have contributed any thing to their di≈øturbance; it was my own bu≈øine≈øs, what≈øoever hath been done, that hath been to evil, or lo≈øs, though I deny both of them in my Intentions: I come not here to accu≈øe any man, nor to excu≈øe my ≈øelf, but to prai≈øe God for all his deliverances; yet I know I ≈øhall do God a great deal of Service, and them a great deal of Ju≈øtice, in not involving any of my company in any thing of mi≈øchief. I cannot an≈øwer Objections; I finde a man may be in <hi>Turky,</hi> or any place, all the World over, where they will give that Language which they hold fitting; but this is beneath me. Ble≈ø≈øed be Almighty God, that hath called me to the Knowledge of him, and this ready Obedience which I pay, and merciful accepting of my Saviour, and patient Death: And I be≈øeech you all, whatever you are, That you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me with your Prayers, whereby my Soul may be a≈ø≈øi≈øted within me, in that pa≈ø≈øage to my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our whither I am going. I am weak of Body; I have di≈øcontinued long from the Kingdom; I am unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with new Forms; I have de≈øired to ≈øerve God according to his Commandments after the Old way: I have begged mercy of God for all my offences to him; and I have had my pardon ≈øealed from Heaven by the Blood of my Saviour: I beg pardon of all who≈øoever, whether I have offended them, or no: I truly forgive them, and have be≈øought Almighty God to pour his ble≈ø≈øings upon them. I accu≈øe no man, I finde fault, nor quarrel with no man; neither

               <p>Ma≈øter Sheriff, If there be any thing wherein I can give any other ≈øatisfaction to any Chri≈øtian what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in any kinde, as I ≈øpake in general, I ble≈øs Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God from my own Heart, now ≈øo a≈ø≈øi≈øted, by the e≈øpecial Operation, and Motions, and Dictates of the Holy Gho≈øt: if I can know any thing, wherein, or how to be now in my dying (not having ≈øerved God ≈øo well in my life) ≈øerviceable to the Church of God, of Chri≈øt, and the full ≈øatisfaction of any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever, I am here ready: I am unacqainted, but in my exta≈øies to Heaven, there is that Glory I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to. I be≈øeech Almighty God, that he will give me Grace to ble≈øs his holy Name; as for all, as for Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and in him all things, ≈øo particularly for this, That he hath thought me worthy to bring me hither for my Faithfulne≈øs to my Ma≈øter, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I was commanded by my Ma≈øter, that is the mo≈øt Pious, and mo≈øt Ju≈øt Prince in all the World. My Ma≈øter hath ≈øuffered bitterly in <hi>England;</hi> and if there be any failing in his Service, the fault is onely mine. God knows I have done nothing in the bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, but by the in≈øtance of the Merchants; I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Letters, and there they lie: To other things I am a Stranger. I hope that God will give me the Grace of Per≈øeverance in that Chri≈øtian Religion; in that Loyalty to my Prince; in that Love to all the World, that now (being to give up my Account to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116763:7"/>him, that) I may with comfort be received in the Arms of his Mercy.</p>
               <p>If there be any thing, Ma≈øter Sheriff, that I may give ≈øatisfaction in, I am ready to do it according to the poor Talent I have. I will receive my puni≈øhment in the way God hath prepared for me; and many ways I have been taken up. Truly I am bound to all that ≈øee me, and many thou≈øands more ≈øince I came into <hi>England,</hi> not an uncivil look (we had ≈øtrange reports abroad) not an uncivil look from any: God repay them all, and return them from the Throne of his Grace into their own bo≈øoms. And God in particular ble≈øs that Honorable Lady, who was the occa≈øion of the coming of my Lords Grace of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> with the Confirmation of tho≈øe glorious and eternal Me≈ø≈øages of Comfort which now I am going to enjoy: being thankful to all tho≈øe that know me, and know me not; for ≈øince I am come hither, whereas I might have received prejudice in re≈øpect to my Loyalty (which is not the way, now) I have from them all received courte≈øie, the Lord repay them. I thank God I am otherwi≈øe bred, and my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance hath been incorporated, imbodied into my Religion; and be≈øides the great de≈øires of other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that I might not go out of the world, but that the world might ≈øee that the grace of God hath had a perfect Reformation in me, and a willing and thankful Submi≈ø≈øion to his Will, therefore I repent me not of it; but I be≈øeech Almighty God to ble≈øs and pro≈øper all people what≈øoever that to this Kingdom belong. As my Speech is imperfect, ≈øo is my Health. I have forced my ≈øelf in this Di≈øcour≈øe to give that ≈øatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I could. And I be≈øeech you, Mr. Sheriff,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116763:8"/>if you can hear of any Gentlemen that are wronged, what I offer here, I am to an≈øwer it; and I be≈øeech you joyn with me in your Chri≈øtian Prayers, that I may have a pa≈ø≈øage whither I am now going to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, not onely of every deed, but of every word.</p>
